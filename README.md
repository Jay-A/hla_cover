# HLA Solver Prototype

A modular, configurable, and Jupyter-safe prototype for solving greedy HLA allele coverage problems. Designed to be YAML-driven and extendable to high-performance backends (e.g., `mpi4py`, C++).

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jay-A/hla_cover.git
cd hla_cover
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Or use your preferred environment manager (e.g. `conda`, `pipenv`).

### 3. Edit configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to define:
- Dataset path
- Number of iterations
- Backend: `serial`, `thread_pool`, or `process_pool`
- Verbosity, parallel workers, etc.

### 4. Or develop in a Jupyter notebook

Inside `notebook_dev/prototype_dev.ipynb`, import the solver class and instantiate:

```python
import sys, os

# Set up project root path
project_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.getcwd(), ".."))
if project_root not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, project_root)

from hla_solver import HLASolver

# Path to config file
config_path = os.path.join(project_root, "configs", "cover_serial_config.yaml")
solver = HLASolver(config_path)
```

The solver object may now be used to freshly begin the problem defined in the config file or be used to restart from a restart\_state file:
```python
best_filters = solver.run()
# or if restarting:
best_filters = solver.run(restart_file="<path/to/restart/file.csv")
```
---

## Configuration Options (`config.yaml`)

Example:

```yaml
# configs/config.yaml

solver:
  max_iter: 15
  top_n: 3
  top_k_global: 3

data:
  dataset_path: "data/simulated_HLA_samples_20000.csv"
  number_doubles: 0

parallel:
  mode: "serial"
  num_workers: 1
  
logging:
  verbose: true
  enable_timing: true
  progress_mode: progress_bar
  log_dir: "logs"

warnings:
  warn_process_pool_in_ipynb: true  
```

## Project Structure

See [`PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) for full directory layout and responsibilities.

---

##  Notes

-  Jupyter-safe: only thread or serial modes recommended in notebooks.
-  Multiprocessing mode will warn if launched from within Jupyter/IPython.
-  Designed to scale into a future C++ or `mpi4py` implementation.
